# Scrollto::Rails6

This is a fork of the project https://github.com/ouvrages/scrollto-rails with the necessary changes to make this gem work in Rails 6 applications (it is also compatible with Rails 5 applications).

This fork was necessary because the original project looks to be innactive.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'scrollto-rails6'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install scrollto-rails6

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` or `bundle install` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. 

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
